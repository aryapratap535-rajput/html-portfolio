<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a results-driven aspiring Web Developer currently deepening my technical foundation by pursuing a diploma in Cyber Forensics and Security. This dual focus gives me a unique perspective: I don't just build applications; I build them with a security-first mindset.</p>
 
  <p>I have acquired essential front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and am aggressively working through a Full-Stack curriculum to master technologies like React and Node.js. My goal is to apply my knowledge of vulnerability analysis and threat modeling directly to development, creating robust, secure, and user-friendly digital solutions. I am eager to contribute to a team focused on developing the next generation of resilient web applications..</p>
